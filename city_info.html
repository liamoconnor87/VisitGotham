                <p>
                    Planning a trip to the nine-island boroughs can be part of the fun, but there’s also a lot of ground to cover. 
                    Below you’ll find quick overviews on other essential things, like the City’s layout, the local time zone and 
                    various visitor passes.
                </p>

                <h2>Geography</h2>
                <p>
                    Gotham City is composed of nine islands. Although the majority of the city consists of the three main 
                    islands; Uptown, Mid-town and Down-town Island. All nine islands are linked by bridges, tunnels and ferries. 

                    <br>

                    </a>

                    <br>

                    Mid-town Island is roughly 12.4 miles wide and about 4.3 miles at its longest. Except at its eastern and western 
                    tips, the borough’s avenues run roughly north and south, and streets run east and west. One-way thorough fares are 
                    common, with traffic moving east on even-numbered streets and west on odd-numbered streets. 

                    <br>

                    Robinson Park is regarded as the centre of the city dividing into east and west sides. As you move farther east or west 
                    from Robinson Park, street addresses increase, usually in increments of 100 from one block to the next. For north-south 
                    avenues, 20 blocks equals a mile, and the street numbers increase as you go towards Uptown Island. Blocks can be a useful 
                    measure of distance, but keep in mind your direction: walking towards Uptown Island from 1st Street to 6th Street is 
                    about a quarter of a mile, but walking the same number of blocks across town, from First Avenue to Sixth Avenue, is 
                    approximately a mile.

                    If you’re headed out for a night on the town, you should know that the drinking age in Gotham—and throughout 
                    the United States—is 21, and smoking is banned in public places throughout the City, including bars, restaurants, 
                    subways and taxis, and public parks and beaches. Cigar smoking is permitted at cigar bars. In Gotham, only those 
                    who are 21 or older can purchase cigarettes and other tobacco products and electronic cigarettes. Under current 
                    law, marijuana remains illegal in the City (and state), though a government-backed push toward its legalization 
                    may change things as early as 2021.

                    Be aware of your surroundings, and make sure to always use licensed, reputable businesses for any services you need. For 
                    example, don’t hail livery cabs (as opposed to taxis) at the airport, and don’t rent bikes from companies that seem suspicious.
